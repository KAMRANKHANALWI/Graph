## 🤔 What Are Graphs?

Think of graphs as a way to represent **relationships** between things:

| 🌍 Real World                   | 📊 Graph Representation                   |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Cities connected by roads       | Vertices = Cities, Edges = Roads          |
| People connected by friendships | Vertices = People, Edges = Friendships    |
| Web pages connected by links    | Vertices = Pages, Edges = Hyperlinks      |
| Computers in a network          | Vertices = Computers, Edges = Connections |

### 📝 Formal Definition

A graph is a collection of **vertices** (nodes) connected by **edges**.

```
Simple Graph Example:
    A ---- B
    |      |
    |      |
    C ---- D
```

### 🔄 Types of Graphs

| **Undirected Graph** | **Directed Graph**   |
| -------------------- | -------------------- |
| Friendships (mutual) | Following on Twitter |
| Roads (both ways)    | One-way streets      |
| `A ─── B`            | `A ──→ B`            |

---

## 📊 Graph Representations

### 1️⃣ **Edge List** - Simple & Intuitive

```python
edges = [
    [0, 1],  # Node 0 connects to Node 1
    [0, 3],  # Node 0 connects to Node 3
    [1, 2],  # Node 1 connects to Node 2
    [3, 4],  # Node 3 connects to Node 4
]
```

### 2️⃣ **Adjacency Matrix** - Quick Lookups

```python
matrix = [
    [0, 1, 0, 1],  # Node 0 connects to 1,3
    [0, 0, 1, 0],  # Node 1 connects to 2
    [0, 0, 0, 0],  # Node 2 connects to nothing
    [0, 0, 0, 1],  # Node 3 connects to 3 (self-loop)
]
```

### 3️⃣ **Adjacency List** - Most Popular! 🏆

```python
graph = {
    0: [1, 3],    # Node 0 connects to 1,3
    1: [2],       # Node 1 connects to 2
    2: [],        # Node 2 connects to nothing
    3: [4, 6, 7], # Node 3 connects to 4,6,7
}
```

**🎯 Try it yourself**: Run `python code/1_basics/graph_representations.py` to see all three in action!

## 🚶‍♂️ Traversal Algorithms

### 🕳️ **Depth-First Search (DFS)**

**"Go as deep as possible, then backtrack"**

```python
def dfs_recursive(graph, node, visited=None):
    if visited is None:
        visited = set()

    visited.add(node)
    print(f"Visiting: {node}")

    for neighbor in graph.get(node, []):
        if neighbor not in visited:
            dfs_recursive(graph, neighbor, visited)

    return visited
```

**🎯 Use DFS for**: Finding paths, detecting cycles, tree traversal

### 🌊 **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**

**"Visit all neighbors first, then their neighbors"**

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(graph, start):
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([start])
    visited.add(start)

    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        print(f"Visiting: {node}")

        for neighbor in graph.get(node, []):
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append(neighbor)

    return visited
```

**🎯 Use BFS for**: Shortest paths, level-order traversal, finding nearest neighbors

### 📊 **Visual Comparison**

| Algorithm | Data Structure  | Exploration Pattern | Best For       |
| --------- | --------------- | ------------------- | -------------- |
| **DFS**   | Stack/Recursion | 🕳️ Deep first       | Paths, cycles  |
| **BFS**   | Queue           | 🌊 Wide first       | Shortest paths |

**🎯 See them in action**: Run `python code/2_traversal/traversal_comparison.py`
